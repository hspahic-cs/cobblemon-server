# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

One version covers the entire repo: the modpack (`modpack/pack.toml`) and the
custom mod (`custom-mods/cobblemon-npc/gradle.properties`) move together. The
git tag (`vX.Y.Z`) is the source of truth — see the Releasing section in the
root README.

## [Unreleased]

### Changed
- Repo restructure: custom mod moved to `custom-mods/cobblemon-npc/`; reference
  clones of upstream mod sources are no longer tracked (gitignored under
  `mods/`). See `docs/upstream-sources.md` for upstream links and expected
  local layout.

## [0.2.2] - 2026-04-25

Initial public-ish state. Modpack at 0.2.2, custom mod at 0.1.0 — versions
unified going forward.
